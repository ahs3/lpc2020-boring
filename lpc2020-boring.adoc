## Abstract
When RISC-V grows up, it wants to be a wildly successful
computing platform.  Being an ISA is fun but being the world's
fastest supercomputer would be really cool.

So how do we get there?  By being dead boring.  If I have an operating
system to install on a platform built around the RISC-V ISA, the install
*_MUST_* work out of the box -- no mucking about with strange boot loaders,
or grabbing odd bits of firmware and kernel patches.  To do that means
standardizing what a RISC-V platform looks like so that an OEM knows
exactly what must be built, and so that an operating system knows what
exactly what hardware and firmware it will find.

And let's just say that right now, the RISC-V Platform Specification has
a long way to go to.  An OEM can only guess at what needs to
be built; an OS can only run by using a lot of fiddly bits.  These
are some of my thoughts on what needs to be done:

. A clear vision
. A clear process
. A clear -- and complete -- specification

We'll even talk about some suggestions for getting these things done.

## Agenda
* So what about the Vision Thing?
* Getting things done
* Filling in all the blanks
** What do we have?
** An outline for what we need
* More Discussion

## The Vision Thing
* Unix-class platform specification
** First thought: _too_ boring:
*** What about the  various BSDs, RTOSs, and, yes, even Windows?
*** Suggestion: make it an OS Platform Spec
** Second thought: what's the goal?
*** Set expectations for OSs: processor, devices, and firmware
* Operating System Platform Spec
** Clearly identify RISC-V ISA in use, and what to do when something
is missing
** Clearly define IO: required buses, required devices
** Detailed specification of the interface between OS and firmware
*** and between OS and hardware _via_ firmware
*** and so that virtualization is possible

## Getting things done
* We have github: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-platform-specs
* Current process is: discuss _ad infinitum_ on mailing list?
* Let's make this simple:
.. RFC on the mailing list
.. On reasonable consensus, submit github merge request
.. Commits must have SoB
.. MR multiple approvals?  Voting?
.. Who has final authority to merge?
* Versioning?

## Filling in all the blanks
### What We Have
What follows is the sum total of the content currently in the platform
specification.

* Can you build an SBC, or a laptop, or a server to be used
with a general purpose OS with this list of requirements?
* Can you modify an operating system -- Linux or that other one -- that
will reliably boot on any platform meeting these requirements?

#### User-Level Platform

* User-mode environments must implement at least version 2.2 of the RISC-V User
  ISA specification, which can be found at
  https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/blob/master/release/riscv-spec-v2.2.pdf.  
* User-mode programs may not execute the `fence.i` instruction.
* User-mode environments may provide additional ISA extensions, but if those
  extensions add user-visible state they must be initially disabled.
* Within main-memory regions, aligned instruction fetch must be atomic, up to
  the smaller of ILEN and XLEN bits.  In particular, if an aligned 4-byte word
  is stored with the `sw` instruction, then any processor attempts to execute
  that word, the processor either fetches the newly stored word, or some previous
  value stored to that location.  (That is, the fetched instruction is not an
  unpredictable value, nor is it a hybrid of the bytes of the old and new
  values.)

#### Supervisor-Level Platform

* Supervisor-mode environments must implement at least version 0.2.0 of the
  RISC-V SBI specification, which can be found at
  https://github.com/riscv/riscv-sbi-doc/blob/v0.2.0/riscv-sbi.adoc
* Supervisor-mode environments must implement the Sv39 page-based
  virtual-memory scheme.   Systems that support Sv48 must support Sv39, systems
  that support Sv57 must support Sv48, and so forth.
* Unless otherwise specified by a given I/O device, I/O regions are at least
  point-to-point strongly ordered.  All devices attached to a given PCIe root
  complex are on the same ordered channel (numbered 2 or above), though
  different root complexes might not be on the same ordering channel.
* On RV64I-based Unix-class systems the negative virtual addresses are reserved
  for the kernel.
* External devices (DMA engines, the debug unit, non RISC-V cores, etc) that
  are visible to RISC-V harts must appear as coherent agents, just like any
  RISC-V hart would.  If additional ordering constraints are necessary for a
  device to function, those will be provide by a device-specific mechanism.

#### Portable UNIX Platform Profile

* Supervisor-mode environments must implement RV64GC.

### What We Need
#### Outlining What We Need

* Fair warning:
** Much of the mailing list discussion seems to be detailed only
** The author tends to think from the general to the detailed
** And he has a lot to do:
*** Catch up on the mailing list
*** Pull in Atish's suggestions

#### Outlining What We Need: Overall Structure

* Hardware: CPU, memory, IO devices and buses
* Monitor: TEE, Hardware Initialization and Run-Time Support
* Boot Sequence: hardware->firmware->boot loader->kernel -- the protocols
* Kernel: device enumeration and management
* Profiles: the specific subsets of the above

### Outlining What We Need: Hardware

* Hardware
** CPU
*** Required ISA Components
*** Privilege Levels and their Usage
*** Identification: make, model, modules available, topology
*** Performance Monitoring
*** Debug Instructions
*** Trace Instructions
*** Timers
*** Virtualization
** Memory
*** MMU
*** Addressability
*** Page Sizes
*** EDAC
** I/O
*** IPL
*** Interrupt Controllers
*** MMIO
*** IOMMU (and virt-iommu)
*** Buses
*** Serial Console
*** Base Management Controller
*** TPM?
*** Debug Port (JTAG?)

### Outlining What We Need: Monitor
* Monitor (M-mode)
** Trusted Execution Environment (another privilege level?)
** CPU (services in UEFI terms)
*** power on/off
*** frequency management
*** Does identification go here or in ISA?
** Firmware update

### Outlining What We Need: Boot Sequence
* Booting the platform
** Network boot
** More console details?
** Firmware update

### Outlining What We Need: Kernel
* Kernel (S-mode)
** Firmware update
* User Space (U-mode)
** Firmware update

### Outlining What We Need: Profiles
* Defining a profile
** Build a checklist: one from Column A, one from Column B ....
** Determining compliance
** RISC-V Certified?

## More Discussion
* What else?
** Form factors like mini-iTX and so on?
